# Why Upgrade?

With v2 we include learnings from over 3 years of Friendly Captcha. This document outlines the reasons why you should switch to v2.

## An overview

* V2 has improved protection. It provides us with more powerful signals to detect abuse, automated browsers, and browsers that have otherwise been tampered with.
* V2 improves on user experience. It has an updated design and the ability to store solutions for future submissions.
* V2 has a smaller speed difference between older and newer browsers.
* V2 is easier to integrate:
  * It automatically matches the language of your website. 
  * It has better support for uncommon use-cases such as multiple widgets on one page.
  * It offers a reCAPTCHA and hCaptcha compatibility build, making switching easier.
  * It has simplified strict content security policy (CSP) requirements.
  * It supports ancient operating systems that do not support Let's Encrypt SSL certificates (such as Windows XP Service Pack 2).
  * There are [official SDKs and plugins](../../integrations/index.md) for common programming languages and frameworks.

## What has not changed?

* Friendly Captcha protects your websites and web apps from bots and abuse.
* There are no user tasks such as clicking cars, and there are no cookies or user tracking involved.
* It supports the same old browsers such as Internet Explorer 11.
* It offers an EU-only infrastructure option, where we guarantee your users' data does not touch any US-owned server.
* The code that runs in your website is open source, so you can be certain you will not be compromised even if we would get compromised.

## When can I upgrade?

V2 is currently available on an invite-only basis. V2 will be available to all users later this year.

## What happens to V1?
V1 will keep working and we will maintain it moving forward for multiple years.

At some point we will not allow newly created sitekeys to use V1.
