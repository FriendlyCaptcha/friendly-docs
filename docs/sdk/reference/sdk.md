## sdk package

A library for integrating Friendly Captcha into your website. This SDK allows you to create captcha widgets, respond to their changes, and interact with them programmatically.

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [FriendlyCaptchaSDK](./sdk.friendlycaptchasdk.md) | <p>Main entry point for V2 of the Friendly Captcha SDK. This class keeps track of widgets and allows you to create widgets programmatically.</p><p>Generally there should only be one instance of this SDK in your website.</p> |
|  [WidgetHandle](./sdk.widgethandle.md) | <p>This provides an API stub that provides the end-user JS API for a widget.</p><p>This class is only instantiated by the SDK - do not create a handle yourself.</p> |

## Type Aliases

|  Type Alias | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [APIEndpoint](./sdk.apiendpoint.md) | Which API endpoint to use for the SDK. Typically "eu" or "global", but a URL can be used to specify a custom endpoint. Defaults to "global". |
|  [FRCEventData](./sdk.frceventdata.md) | Payloads of any of the events that can be dispatched by a widget. |
|  [FRCEventName](./sdk.frceventname.md) | Names of any of the events that can be dispatched by a widget. |
|  [FRCWidgetCompleteEvent](./sdk.frcwidgetcompleteevent.md) | Event that gets dispatched when the widget is completed. This happens when the user's browser has succesfully passed the captcha challenge. |
|  [FRCWidgetStateChangeEvent](./sdk.frcwidgetstatechangeevent.md) | Event that gets dispatched when the widget enters a new state. |
|  [FRCWidgetWidgetErrorEvent](./sdk.frcwidgetwidgeterrorevent.md) | Event that gets dispatched when something goes wrong in the widget. |
|  [FRCWidgetWidgetExpireEvent](./sdk.frcwidgetwidgetexpireevent.md) | Event that gets dispatched when the widget expires. This happens when the user takes too long to submit the captcha after it is solved. |
|  [FRCWidgetWidgetResetEvent](./sdk.frcwidgetwidgetresetevent.md) | Event that gets dispatched when something goes wrong in the widget. |
|  [SentinelResponse](./sdk.sentinelresponse.md) | Response values used in the hidden input field when no valid solution is present, these tell you something about the state of the widget. |
|  [StartMode](./sdk.startmode.md) | <p>The start mode of the widget.</p><p>\* <code>&quot;auto&quot;</code>: the widget gets activated as soon as it is created. \* <code>&quot;focus&quot;</code>: the widget gets activated as soon as the form above it is focused. \* <code>&quot;none&quot;</code>: The widget does not get activated automatically at all, the user needs to press the widget (or <code>.start()</code> gets called using the Javascript API).</p> |
|  [WidgetErrorCode](./sdk.widgeterrorcode.md) | <p>Error codes that can be returned by the widget.</p><p>\* <code>&quot;network_error&quot;</code>: The user's browser could not connect to the Friendly Captcha API. \* <code>&quot;sitekey_invalid&quot;</code>: The sitekey is invalid. \* <code>&quot;sitekey_missing&quot;</code>: The sitekey is missing. \* <code>&quot;other&quot;</code>: Some other error occurred.</p><p>In all cases it's the best practice to enable the "submit" button when the widget errors, so that the user can still perform the action despite not having solved the captcha.</p> |
|  [WidgetResetTrigger](./sdk.widgetresettrigger.md) | What caused the widget to reset. \* <code>root</code>: Code on the root page (= your website code or plugin) caused the reset. \* <code>widget</code>: The reset came from the widget. The user likely clicked the reset button within the widget. \* <code>agent</code>: The reset came from the agent - this currently does not happen but may in the future. |
|  [WidgetState](./sdk.widgetstate.md) | The state the widget is in. See the \[widget lifecycle\](../lifecycle) docs for more information. |
