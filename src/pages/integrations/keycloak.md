# Keycloak Integration

Two high-quality Keycloak integrations are available to integrate Friendly Captcha into your Keycloak instance.

* [**Keycloak Friendly Captcha** by DSB Norge](https://github.com/dsb-norge/keycloak-friendly-captcha), this supports the registration flow only.
* [**Keycloak Friendly Captcha** by Touqeer Shafi](https://github.com/touqeershafi/keycloak-friendly-captcha), which extends a wide range of flows and can be configured more extensively.

Both integrations are open source and free to use. Please refer to their respective GitHub repositories for installation instructions and documentation.
