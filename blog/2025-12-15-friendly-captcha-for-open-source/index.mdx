At Friendly Captcha we are strong believers in open source. We have released a number of open source tools and libraries, and we contribute back where we can. We believe open source is the bedrock of software development.

To back up that belief, we’re now pleased to announce the launch of **Friendly Captcha for Open Source**, a free plan available for open source, non-commercial projects. Friendly Captcha for Open Source provides the same level of access as the Friendly Captcha Advanced plan: up to 50,000 protected requests per month with up to 50 protected domains (with a value of €2,400 per year).

Our hope with this offering is to be able to give something else back to the open source community, which often doesn't have the budget to defend against abuse and unwanted traffic.

To apply for access, visit [Friendly Captcha for Open Source](https://friendlycaptcha.com/for-open-source). There you’ll find the eligibility requirements and the application form.
