On Friendly Captcha’s engineering team, we are strong believers in open source. Our client-side SDK is open source, and so are all of our server-side SDKs for different programming languages and environments. And beyond our open source product offerings, many of us on the team devote time to open source contributions to support the community. We believe open source is the bedrock of software development.

To back up that belief, we’re now pleased to announce the launch of **Friendly Captcha for Open Source**, a free plan available for open source, non-commercial projects. Friendly Captcha for Open Source provides the same level of access as the Friendly Captcha Advanced plan: up to 50,000 protected requests per month with up to 50 protected domains (with a value of €2,400 per year).

Our hope with this offering is to be able to give something back to the open source community, and make it easier for open source projects to secure themselves against unwanted traffic.

To apply for access, visit [Friendly Captcha for Open Source](https://friendlycaptcha.com/for-open-source). There you’ll find the eligibility requirements and the application form.

We’re excited to read your applications and to see what you’re building! And looking forward to seeing the ways you use Friendly Captcha to secure your projects.
