Friendly Captcha has been used to protect mobile apps since we started in 2020, but it required a custom integration each time.

We are happy to announce an official mobile SDK for Android and iOS. Using an SDK should reduce your integration time from days to under an hour.

# Device Support

Accessibility is a core value at Friendly Captcha. That means supporting the widest possible set of devices we can, to avoid excluding anyone. These mobile SDKs have been built to work on devices and operating systems that are over 10 years old.

| **Platform** | **Supported Version** |
| --- | --- |
| Android | ≥ Android 4.1 (API level 16) |
| iOS | ≥ iOS 10 officially supported |
| iOS | ≥ iOS 8 on a best effort basis |
