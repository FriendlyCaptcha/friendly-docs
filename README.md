## Contribute to our localizations

Are you a (near-)native speaker of a language that is not yet supported? You can help [translate the widget here](https://poeditor.com/join/project/lrdZQ5Uk6D). Thank you for your contribution!

## Local Development
> Note: You don't have to run it locally to contribute. You can also edit the markdown files in the `docs` folder using your favorite text editor.


Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed.

```shell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run locally with live reload
npm run start
```

Now open your browser and point it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). When you edit a file and save it, it should be visible immediately.

## Building

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
